# hScore
hScore is an algorithm for scoring a person's health.
hScore is a number from 1 to 100 that is correlated with a persons health behaviors and metrics. As more metrics are added, hScore is updated to reflect the aggregate information.

hScore is currently a concept and has not been developed.
